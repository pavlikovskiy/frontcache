 * A top-level request was served - the request log's line, as an event. <b>Sampled</b>: a node delivers each
 * request to a subscriber with the probability {@code front-cache.plugins.<id>.request-sample} (default
 * {@value #DEFAULT_SAMPLE}; {@code 1.0} delivers every request, and the node WARNs at start that it does). Includes
 * are not events of their own; a request a guard rule rejected or redirected is a {@link GuardMatched}.
 *
 * @param requestId     the request's id
 * @param method        the HTTP method
 * @param uri           host + path + query, truncated to {@value FcEvent#MAX_URI_LENGTH}
 * @param outcome       {@code success}, or {@code error} when a fallback was served
 * @param cacheable     whether the request went through the cache ({@code cacheable}) or straight to the origin
 * @param cache         {@code from-cache}, {@code dynamic} (the origin answered) or {@code dynamic-soft} (a soft
 *                      refresh)
 * @param runtimeMillis how long it took
 * @param lengthBytes   the response body's length
 * @param clientKey     the client's resolved address; personal data, see {@link FcEvent}
 * @param clientType    the bots.conf verdict - {@code bot}, {@code guest}, ...; may be null
 * @param clientRule    the bots.conf rule that decided it, or null
 * @param userAgent     the User-Agent header, truncated to {@value FcEvent#MAX_URI_LENGTH}; may be null
 * @param fallbackReason why a fallback was served, when {@code outcome} is {@code error}; null otherwise
