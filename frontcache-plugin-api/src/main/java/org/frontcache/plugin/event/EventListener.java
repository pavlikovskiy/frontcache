 * allocation when nobody did) and, if so, builds the event and {@code offer}s it into <b>this listener's own
 * bounded queue</b>. A full queue drops the event and counts it. One thread per listener drains the queue and
 * calls {@link #onEvents} with what has accumulated, up to 500 events at a time. A listener that throws is logged
 * (rate-limited) and keeps receiving; one that blocks only fills - and then overflows - its own queue.
