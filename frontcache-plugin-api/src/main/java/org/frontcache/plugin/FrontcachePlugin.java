/**
 * A plugin: code from its own jar that plugs into a node. Its jar carries
 * {@value PluginManifest#RESOURCE}, which names this class ({@code class = ...}) and declares what the plugin is
 * ({@link PluginManifest}); the node instantiates the class through its public no-argument constructor.
 *
 * <h2>Kinds</h2>
 *
 * What a plugin may contribute is decided by the {@code kinds} its manifest declares, and checked: a plugin that
 * hands the node an {@link EventListener} without declaring {@link PluginKind#OBSERVE}, or a management action
 * without {@link PluginKind#MANAGE}, is refused at start. Each method below names its kind.
 *
 * <h2>A plugin that fails is a plugin that is absent</h2>
 *
 * Every call into a plugin is wrapped by the node. A plugin that throws in {@link #start} is logged and dropped
 * until the next start, and the node starts regardless; what "absent" means for each kind is decided by the core,
 * never by the plugin, and is always the behaviour of a node that never had it.
 *
 * <h2>One instance per process</h2>
 *
 * A plugin is instantiated once and outlives an engine: the {@code reload} action calls {@code stop(false)} then
 * {@code start(...)} on the same instance. The constructor must be cheap and side-effect free - it may run from a
 * servlet's init, before any engine.
